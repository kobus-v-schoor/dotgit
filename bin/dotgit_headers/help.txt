SYNOPSIS:
    Dotgit is an easy-to-use and versatile dotfile manager. It allows you to
    effortlessly move, backup and synchronise your dotfiles between different
    machines. The main ideas that dotgit revolves around are the following:

    - Use a single git repository for ALL your dotfiles (arbitrary amount of
      machines)
    - Straightforward git repo that can be used even when you don't have access
      to dotgit
    - Keep different versions of the same file in the same repo (eg. different
      .bashrc files for different setups) (categories)
    - Easy-to-use commands and setup
    - Do all the heavy-lifting git work (only if you want to)

INITIAL SETUP:
    Firstly create an online git repository (eg. on GitHub). Clone this
    repository to your home folder ('git clone {repo_url} {repo_dest}', check
    online for more details). Next, cd into the repository and run 'dotgit
    init'. Next, setup your dogit repository by editing the filelist as
    explained in the "filelist syntax" section

FILELIST SYNTAX:
    There are only two files inside your dotgit repository that you will be
    editing. They have the names 'filelist' and 'cryptlist'. Both use the same
    syntax and are identical in every way except for the fact that files
    specified inside 'cryptlist' will be encrypted before they are added to the
    repository.

    The filelist uses '#' at the beginning of a line do denominate a comment.
    Blank lines are ignored.

    The filelists use the following syntax:

    file_name:category1,category2

    or simply:

    file_name

    "file_name" can contain spaces and can be any file or folder inside your
    home directory. Categories are a very powerful tool that you can use to
    group files together. If no category is specified it is implicitly added to
    the "common" category. When you specify multiple categories for a single
    file dotgit will link their files together and they will share the exact
    same file. You can also use categories to separate different versions of the
    same file. For example:

    .vimrc:c1,c2
    .vimrc:c3

    In this example categories c1 and c2 will share the same .vimrc and c3 will
    have its own version of .vimrc. Categories can be anything you want it to be
    but its most straight-forward usage is the hostnames of the machines that
    you will be using dotgit on.

ENCRYPTION:
    Dotgit has support AES encryption of your dotfiles through PGP. To enable
    encryption of a file simply add the filename to the 'cryptlist' file.

    To incorporate encryption dotgit makes use of a "dmz" folder, a "middle-man"
    folder where all of your encrypted files will be decrypted and from there
    linked to your home folder. This "dmz" folder is inside your repository but
    never added to any of your commits. This also means that whenever you
    make a change to an encrypted dotfile you will have to re-encrypt the file
    (the changes you make will not be automatically added to your repo unlike
    with normal files). To do this you will simply need to cd into your dotfiles
    repository and run 'dotgit encrypt'. More details in the "options" section.

DIRECTORY SUPPORT:
    Dotgit does have support for directories but it is not as versatile and
    forgiving as with normal files as it has a few caveats. Due to the fact that
    dotgit cannot possibly know beforehand what files will reside in a folder it
    needs to determine it at runtime. This means that you will need to take a
    few things in consideration:

    - When running 'dotgit update' all the files in the directory that you want
      there needs to be present (whether they are symlinks to the repo or the
      files themselves). If a file is removed from the folder and you update the
      repository, the file will be removed from the repository as well.
    - When running 'dotgit restore' the destination directory needs to be empty
      or non-existant, otherwise restore will not use the files in the
      repository and remove them.

OPTIONS:
    Usage: dotgit (verbose) [option] (optional categories)

    You can prepend "verbose" to any of the options to enable verbose mode which
    will output dotgit's actions along the way. If you find a problem with
    dotgit please open an issue on github along with this "Verbose" output.

    If you don't add any categories after your option, two categories, "common"
    and your hostname will be implicitly added. When you add categories only the
    files that are in those categories will be taken into consideration. For
    instance, if you specify "c1" after "update" only files marked with the "c1"
    category will be updated. Options with "(args)" after their name support
    categories.

    init           - Setup a new dotgit repository inside the current directory

    update (args)  - Run this after you changed either of your filelists. This
                     will update the repository structures to match your
                     filelists. Do not use this if you only modified your
                     dotfiles, it is unnecessary.

    restore (args) - Run this to create links from your home folder to your
                     repository. You need to run this whenever you want to setup
                     a new machine or if you made changes to the filelists on
                     antoher machine and you want the changes to be added to the
                     current machine. Take note that dotgit will first remove
                     old links to your dotfiles repository and then create the
                     new links. You will thus need to specify all the categories
                     that you want to restore in one run. When running restore
                     dotgit will automatically try to decrypt your files

    clean          - This will remove all links in your home folder that point
                     to your dotfiles repository

    encrypt        - This will encrypt all the files that you modified since
                     your last encryption. Whenever you modify an encrypted
                     dotfile and want to save the changes to your repository you
                     will need to run this.

    decrypt        - This will decrypt all files inside your repository and
                     overwrite the version inside your "dmz" folder. You should
                     run decrypt after pulling in new changes from a remote.

    passwd         - Change your dotgit password.

    diff           - This will print your current changes in your dotfiles
                     repository as well as unencrypted changes. Please note that
                     this will not show unencrypted files that were deleted.

    generate       - This will generate a git commit message and push to a
                     remote if it can find one

    help           - Show this message

    'update', 'restore' and the 'clean' option have a 'hard' mode, activated by
    prepending 'hard-' to the option, eg. 'hard-update'. When in this mode
    dotgit will copy the files to/from the repository rather than symlinking it.
    In the case of 'clean' it will also remove files and not just symlinks. This
    can be useful if you want to for example clone the repository onto a
    machine, restore your dotfiles and then delete the repository again.
